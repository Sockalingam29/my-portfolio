  "about": [
    "I work at Fidelity Investments as a Full Stack Engineer. I'm responsible for developing capabilities for Fidelity's Cash Management products like Check-ordering and Direct Deposit. I underwent the flagship LEAP training program in full stack development which includes technologies like Angular, Spring, and Java for a period of 14 weeks. I’ve previously interned at Fidelity for a total of 7 months working on developing capabilities for the Billpay and Credit Card products.",
    "I graduated from Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai in 2024 with a degree in Computer Science. I like developing web applications using the MERN stack. Outside of coding, I’m an avid reader and love diving into random topics—whether it's tech-related or something completely different! I love listening to music and it keeps my mood up all day. "
